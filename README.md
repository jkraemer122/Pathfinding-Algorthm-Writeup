# Pathfinding-Algorthm-Writeup
A writeup for Artifical Intelligence Pathfinding Algorithms on a map of Minneapolis.

## Abstract

In this study, we will go over the perfomrance of two pathnding algorithms: the A* (pronounced
"A star") search algorithm and the Dijkstra algorithm. These algorithms are used to
nd the shortest path in a graph or table and were used to nd the shortest, quckest path in
maps, including the map of Minneapolis. By comparing the search time in both the base map as
well as a larger map of Minneapolis, we can determine an algorithm that is superior in nding
the shortest path. These results can then be applied to theories on pathnding in modern video
games and what can be done to improve NPC (Non-Player Character) movements throughout
the video game world
